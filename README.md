Quick peek on timestamp 18:34, for div class implementation, finally didn't use it, used wc2 method instead, and wrote it my way

For the chart, I followed the tutorial on

For the sova agent I didn't managed to fix it with the isPlayableCharacter = true, but I found an easy solution to skip the first iteration. I chose to use count. 
https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/javascript/for+loop+skip+iteration+javascript, did it my own way (+wc6 method for agentsList)

In the class.js, I followed wc6 tutorial, and implemented with my code

I partly used wc2 code for my role buttons and agentdescription, I struggled a bit on it, so I asked for explanation and managed to resolve it step by step.

In index.js on linecode 183, I used the renderpaintings method from wc2, so this was a code we wrote togheter during a werkcollege to test out.
