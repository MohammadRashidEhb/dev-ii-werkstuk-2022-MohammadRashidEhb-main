for the sova agent i didn't managed to fix it with the isPlayableCharacter = true, but i found an easy solution to skip the first iteration. i chose to use count. 
https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/javascript/for+loop+skip+iteration+javascript, did it on my own way (+wc6 method for agentsList)

for the class.js, i followed wc6 tutorial, and implemented with my code
I partly used wc2 codes for my role buttons and agentdescription, i struggled a bit on it, so i asked for explanation and managed to resolve it step by step.
